   <h2>What is Internet?</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>The Internet is a huge network of computers all over the world that can communicate with each other.</li>
    <li>Computers follow rules called protocols to send and receive information safely and correctly.</li>
    <li>Hum Internet ka use roz karte hain emails bhejne, friends se chat karne, videos dekhne, websites browse karne, online groups join karne, shopping karne, aur ghar ya office ke devices connect karne ke liye.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>IP Address</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>IP stands for Internet Protocol.</li>
    <li>IP Address ek unique address hai jo har computer ko Internet par allot hota hai.</li>
    <li>When you connect your device to the Internet, the Internet service provider (ISP) assigns an IP address to your device. When you disconnect, that IP address can be given to someone else.
        <h4>There are two types of IP (based on assignment) - </h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Static IP Address - </b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Assigned manually or reserved by your ISP.</li>
                    <li>It never changes, no matter how many times you connect.</li>
                    <li>It is like your permanent house that never changes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Dynamic IP Address - </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assigned automatically by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) every time you connect.</li>
                    <li>It changes when you disconnect and reconnect.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic IP is like a temporary house: someone stays for a while, then leaves, and another person can use it.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>There are two types of IP (based on network) - </h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Public IP Address - </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>A Public IP address is your <b>global, unique address on the internet.</b></li>
                    <li>Every device that accesses the Internet gets a unique public IP (assigned by your ISP).</li>
                    <li>It must be <b>globally unique.</b> No two devices on the internet can have the same public IP address at the same time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Private IP Address - </b>
              <ul>
                <li>A Private IP address is a local address used only within your own private network (e.g., your home Wi-Fi, your office network).</li>
                <li>Devices in the same network can see each other using private IPs, but these are not visible on the Internet.</li>
                <li><b>Reserved Ranges: </b>The internet authorities have reserved specific ranges of addresses just for this purpose. If you see an IP address starting with one of these, you know it's a private address:
                  <ul>
                    <li>10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Used by large corporations)</li>
                    <li>172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Used by medium-sized networks)</li>
                    <li>192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Most common for home networks)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
   </ul>
